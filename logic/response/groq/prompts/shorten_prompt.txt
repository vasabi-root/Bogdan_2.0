1. Carefully read and understand the original summary to grasp its central idea or viewpoint.
2. Identify and retain the most critical information or key points from the original summary.
3. Distill the summary down to its absolute essential elements, removing any unnecessary details, context, self-advocations, or superfluous information.
4. Aim to convey the core idea or viewpoint in the most concise phrasing possible, preferably a few words or a single sentence.
5. Ensure that the condensed summary remains accurate, objective, and faithful to the original summary's meaning.
6. If the condensed summary risks losing critical context or nuance, consider adding a brief clarifying phrase or qualifier.
7. Omit any self-advocating statements, attempts to justify or defend the viewpoint, or unnecessary explanations or rationalizations. Focus solely on the core idea or viewpoint itself.
